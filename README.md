Motivation/Purpose: The motivation for this project was debugging and cleaning up both css and html to have a cleaner code.

Problem Solved!: The problem solved was creating a cleaner, semantic code that allows developers to more easily edit and understand the functions of the website.

What I Learned: I learned to take each section of the code one at a time. This allows for hyperfocus on one area before moving on to the next. I also learned to make a ton of changes and test each time to ensure that it functions properly. I also learned how to consolidate code and create a more legible overall code.

What Makes the Project Stand Out: This website's true improvements were on the developer side rather than the user. The user benefits from clickable links from a navigation bar to the section of the page. For developers, when they go in to look at the code to either edit, add, or delete, they will understand what is happening and the functions of specific elements.
